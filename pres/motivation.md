# I can haz clojure?




## Clojure is a LISP
Lost In Stupid Parenthesis




## Clojure Targets Multiple Platforms
_"VMs, not OSes, are the platforms of the future"_


Java, Javascript and .NET




## Designed Ground up for Concurrency
_"Locking is too hard to get right over and over again"_

Software Transactional Memory, Agents, Go inspired async






## Clojure is General Purpose
But not a hammer for every nail





## Most languages try to incorporate some LISP
_"Often emulated/pillaged, still not duplicated"_





## Tooling 

Needs work, being improved everyday, can still catch you off-gaurd






## Clojurescript Tooling
Behind Clojure tooling, tons of projects to make your life easier.





## Error Reporting

Needs improvement!!

Plugins are available, not always trivial.
